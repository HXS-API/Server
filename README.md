# HXS IATI Database, Server and API

HXS is being principally built using Python and AWS components.

## Workflow and Output

HXS will regularly scrape aid activity files published by humanitarian organizations on their own web servers, database XML file information then re-serve the information via an enterprise-grade API.

The new API will provide developers with the apility to query IATI's entire corpus using any of IATI's 217 plus unique information fields and use the access point to power applications creating, reading, updating and deleting information from the HXS IATI database.

## Operations

HXS will carry out the following four principle operations:

* Identify the URLs of all known IATI files
* Extract XML from the files and generate one single XML file
* Process the XML file and database the information
* Automate the process on a daily or other schedule
